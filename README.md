## My personal Opinion
  This project is one of the understanding regarding implementation of __local storage__ using __javascript__. Though, there can be many things that can
  be done more to this but I gave my best as per my knowledge and understanding. Finally this project is accomplished !
## How to use / usage guidance
  Since this project is the __implementation of the local storage__ inside browser so it can be used as:
  - taking short notes (while surfing through the important topics)
  - as a sort of short version of to-do list app
